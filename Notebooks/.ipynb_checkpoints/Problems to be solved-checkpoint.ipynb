    "### There are a few problems with this program and with the model itself (that can be solved though): \n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimation of Covariance matrix is very messy, .cov() is a rather inaccurate estimation of the covariance matrix \n",
    "- Exp. Returns (Mean Returns) is a quite bad criterion for futurue returns, Markowitz himself said that\n",
    "- mus vector (exponentially distributed), is rather inaccurate at finding the 'true' convex region\n",
    "- The mus vector might be a tricky thing to solve; it is the parameter that the model solves for a given variance - so as of now this is a exponentially distributed scale, which is later multiplied by the covariance matrix in the optimization (see: https://cvxopt.org/examples/book/portfolio.html). More intuitively (and closer to the actual model), mus should be distributed between the minimum return (either simply 0, or the return of the minimum-return asset) and the maximum return asset. The problem is, that the constraint matrices will have to be modified accordingly (instead of multiplying mu by covariance)\n",
    "- This is *the* foundational model in portfolio optimization, better and more robust models have been suggested\n",
    "- Vizualisation and \n",
