# Markowitz (Mean-Variance) Model

--- 

This is a project I worked on for the course MATH441 (Mathematical Modelling and discrete optimization problems). Used a 
similar but simpler for the capstone course. Over the course of the summer I added some new features to the model some that I was
able to find online (the maximum sharp-ratio portfolio) and some that I tediously figured out myself (allowing for short-positions and individual weight restrictions for assets).
